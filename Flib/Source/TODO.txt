FLIB
----

The objective of Flib is to be universal, wich means:

- backward compatibility.
- each library must be less than 8KB (8192 bytes), since it is the limitation when no kernel is installed on some TIOS.

A few ideas of what can still be done:

- Add commentaries (in English) to make the code easier to understand and re-use.
- Correct my English.
